Description: Bioinformatics platform containing interactive plots and tables
    for differential gene and region expression studies. Allows visualizing
    expression data much more deeply in an interactive and faster way. By
    changing the parameters, user can easily discover different parts of the
    data that like never have been done before. Manually creating and looking
    these plots takes time. With this system users can prepare plots without
    writing any code. Differential expression, PCA and clustering analysis are
    made on site and the results are shown in various plots such as scatter,
    bar, box, volcano, ma plots and Heatmaps.
